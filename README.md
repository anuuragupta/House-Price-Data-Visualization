<h1><strong>House Price Data Visualization and Analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python</h1></strong>
<strong>Bar plots can be used to visualize the count of houses in each 'MSZoning' category or each 'Neighborhood'.</strong>
Scatter plot of 'LotFrontage' vs 'SalePrice' can help identify the relationship between the two variables.
Histograms and kernel density plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the 'SalePrice' variable.
Heatmaps can be used to visualize the correlation matrix between different variables, which can help identify strong correlations that might be useful for prediction models.
Boxplots can be used to visualize the distribution of 'SalePrice' for different categories of categorical variables such as 'OverallQual', 'CentralAir', 'KitchenQual', etc.
Violin plots can be used to combine the benefits of a box plot and a kernel density plot to visualize the distribution of 'SalePrice' for different categories of a categorical variable.
Line plots can be used to visualize how the average 'SalePrice' changes with 'YearBuilt' or 'YearRemodAdd'.
