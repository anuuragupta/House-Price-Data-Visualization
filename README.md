<h1><strong>House Price Data Visualization and Analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python</h1></strong>
<p><strong>. Bar plots can be used to visualize the count of houses in each 'MSZoning' category or each 'Neighborhood'.</strong></p>
<p><strong>. Scatter plot of 'LotFrontage' vs 'SalePrice' can help identify the relationship between the two variables.</strong></p>
<p><strong>. Histograms and kernel density plots can be used to visualize the distribution of the 'SalePrice' variable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>. Heatmaps can be used to visualize the correlation matrix between different variables, which can help identify strong correlations that might be useful for prediction models.</strong></p>
<p><strong>. Boxplots can be used to visualize the distribution of 'SalePrice' for different categories of categorical variables such as 'OverallQual', 'CentralAir', 'KitchenQual', etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>. Violin plots can be used to combine the benefits of a box plot and a kernel density plot to visualize the distribution of 'SalePrice' for different categories of a categorical variable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>. Line plots can be used to visualize how the average 'SalePrice' changes with 'YearBuilt' or 'YearRemodAdd'.</strong></p>
